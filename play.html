    <h3>AN IDEAL HUSBAND</h3>
    <h4>_The octagon room at Sir Robert Chiltern’s house in Grosvenor Square_</h4>
    <p>
    <h6 class="name MRS_MARCHMONT">MRS. MARCHMONT</h6>
    <p class="speach">Going on to the Hartlocks’ to-night, Margaret?</p>

    <h6 class="name LADY_BASILDON">LADY BASILDON</h6>
    <p class="speach">suppose so. Are you?</p>

    <h6 class="name MRS_MARCHMONT">MRS. MARCHMONT</h6>
    <p class="speach">Yes. Horribly tedious parties they give, don’t they?</p>

    <h6 class="name LADY_BASILDON">LADY BASILDON</h6>
    <p class="speach">Horribly tedious! Never know why I go. Never know why I
        go anywhere.</p>

    <h6 class="name MRS_MARCHMONT">MRS. MARCHMONT</h6>
    <p class="speach">I come here to be educated</p>

    <h6 class="name LADY_BASILDON">LADY BASILDON</h6>
    <p class="speach">Ah! I hate being educated!</p>

    <h6 class="name MRS_MARCHMONT">MRS. MARCHMONT</h6>
    <p class="speach">So do I. It puts one almost on a level with the
        commercial classes, doesn’t it? But dear Gertrude Chiltern is always
        telling me that I should have some serious purpose in life. So I come
        here to try to find one.</p>

    <h6 class="name LADY_BASILDON">LADY BASILDON<h6>
            <p class="speach">[_Looking round through her lorgnette_.]</p>
            <p class="speach">I don’t see
                anybody here to-night whom one could possibly call a serious purpose.
                The man who took me in to dinner talked to me about his wife the whole
                time.</p>

            <h6 class="name MRS_MARCHMONT">MRS. MARCHMONT</h6>
            <p class="speach">How very trivial of him!</p>

            <h6 class="name LADY_BASILDON">LADY BASILDON</h6>
            <p class="speach">Terribly trivial! What did your man talk about?</p>

            <h6 class="name MRS_MARCHMONT">MRS. MARCHMONT</h6>
            <p class="speach">About myself.</p>

            <h6 class="name LADY_BASILDON">LADY BASILDON</h6>
            <p class="speach">[_Languidly_.] And were you interested?</p>

            <h6 class="name MRS_MARCHMONT">MRS. MARCHMONT</h6>
            <p class="speach">[_Shaking her head_.] Not in the smallest degree.</p>

            <h6 class="name LADY_BASILDON">LADY BASILDON</h6>
            <p class="speach">What martyrs we are, dear Margaret!</p>

            <h6 class="name MRS_MARCHMONT">MRS. MARCHMONT</h6>
            <p class="speach">[_Rising_.] And how well it becomes us, Olivia!</p>

            <h6 class="name LORD_CAVERSHAM">LORD CAVERSHAM</h6>
            <p class="speach">Good evening, Lady Chiltern! Has my good-for-nothing
                young son been here?</p>

            <h6 class="name MRS_MARCHMONT">MRS. MARCHMONT</h6>
            <p class="speach">[_Rising_.] And how well it becomes us, Olivia!</p>


            <h6 class="name LORD_CAVERSHAM">LORD CAVERSHAM<h6>
                    <p class="speach">Because he leads such an idle life.</p>

                    <h6 class="name LADY_BASILDON">LADY BASILDON</h6>
                    <p class="speach">What martyrs we are, dear Margaret!</p>

                    <h6 class="name LORD_CAVERSHAM">LORD CAVERSHAM</h6>
                    <p class="speach">[_Looking at her with a kindly twinkle in his eyes_.]
                        You are a very charming young lady!</p>

                    <h6 class="name MRS_MARCHMONT">MRS. MARCHMONT</h6>
                    <p class="speach">[_Rising_.] And how well it becomes us, Olivia!</p>

                    <h6 class="name LORD_CAVERSHAM">LORD CAVERSHAM</h6>
                    <p class="speach">Never go anywhere now. Sick of London Society.
                        Shouldn’t mind being introduced to my own tailor; he always votes on the
                        right side. But object strongly to being sent down to dinner with my
                        wife’s milliner. Never could stand Lady Caversham’s bonnets.</p>
